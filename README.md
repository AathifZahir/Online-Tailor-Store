## System Overview
The web app works as a way for customers to browse products and place orders through the internet. To unlock full access to the functions  of the system, the user is required to login to the system with their credentials. The customers can create their own credentials by providing information. Information regarding the user is stored in a secured database. Upon logging in, they can add items to their cart, place orders, and track their progress. Additionally, the system includes an admin dashboard accessible to administrators, with credentials created manually.
